multi-stage algorithm

1. Noise Reduction
2. Finding Intensity Gradient of the Image
3. Non-maximum Suppression
4. Hysteresis Thresholding : indicates whether all edges are really edges with minVal and maxVal

- Any edges with intensity gradient more than maxVal are sure to be edges and those below minVal are sure to be non-edges, so discarded

- Those who lie between these two thresholds are classified edges or non-edges based on their connectivity. If they are connected to "sure-edge" pixels, they are considered to be part of edges. Otherwise, they are also discarded.
